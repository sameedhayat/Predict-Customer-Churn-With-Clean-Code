# Predict-Customer-Churn-With-Clean-Code

Identifyinf credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).


The code in churn_library.py should complete data science solution process including:

EDA
Feature Engineering (including encoding of categorical variables)
Model Training
Prediction
Model Evaluation

The sequence diagram below shows the sequence of churn_library.py function calls, and the Document Strings section further shows each function's input/output details.
